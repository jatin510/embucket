      Intermediary model used to create monthly_stage_usage_by_namespace.
      It flattens the SaaS metrics from `prep_saas_usage_ping_namespace`.
      By doing this step in a separate model from `prep_saas_usage_ping_namespace` we get performance gains.

    description: >-
      Summarises per account and score date the scores given by the PtE and PtC models.
      It also solves discrepancies when the score of PtC = 1 and the score of PtE = 5 for the same score date, meaning that the account is highly likely to expand and contract at the same time.
      This is done by lowering or upping the score with the lowest distance to the score mean relative to its standard deviation.
      If the score with the lowest variance is the PtC, then the score will go from 1 to 2.
      If the score with the lowest variance is the PtE, then the score will go from 5 to 4.

      Maps Free Self-Managed instances to CRM accounts.
      It does so in a 3 stage process:
        1. Tries to join the host_name of the instance to the account domain registered in SFDC.
        2. If above does not work, tries to extract the company name from the host_name and join it to the company name in SFDC
        3. If above does not work, joins the host_name to the email address domain of leads associated to accounts.
      This model runs in the second of every month. If the run is skipped, will try to run on the next day.
